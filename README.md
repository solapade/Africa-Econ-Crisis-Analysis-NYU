Technologies Used: Python (numpy, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn)
I contributed to this group project work by conducting exploratory data analysis. 
Visualizations of domestic and sovereign debt counts for each of the countries were created and observations were noted.
Time series graph of the annual inflation CPI for each country were plotted, trends were identified and conclusions were drawn.
An analysis of exchange rate and currency crisis for each country was also done to identify the trends before and after independence. This analysis was visualized in a time series plot.
